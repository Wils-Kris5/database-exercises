# Indexes, also referred to as indices, are used to optimize queries and ensure integrity of data.
# Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this costs.
#  Using Indexes
# We use indexes on almost every table we create. At the very least, we are going to set a primary key, or a unique identifier for each row, much like a row number in a spreadsheet. This will give us the ability to easily reference the data in that row, and MySQL will make sure there are never duplicates.
